            <p>Team DRIP (Diabetes Reduction Initiative in Puerto Penasco) is a project team under M-HEAL at the University of Michigan. Our mission is to use a two-pronged technical and educational approach to alleviate the effects of high rates of diabetes on the community of Puerto Penasco, Mexico. Our <a href = "technical.html">technical subteam</a> aims to build a low-cost, adaptable prosthetic for diabetic amputees in Puerto Penasco in order to help them regain mobility and return to work. Our <a href = "educational.html">educational subteam</a> is working to spread awareness about wound care and diabetic foot ulcers, by creating an informational pamphlet in Spanish to be distributed at local clinics.</p>

                <p id = "historyText">Team DRIP is working with the community of Puerto Penasco, Mexico, to alleviate the effects of high rates of diabetes on the community. Puerto Penasco is a small tourist town with a population of about 60,000. This mission was born from a needs assessment conducted by our overarching organization, <a href = "https://mheal.engin.umich.edu">M-HEAL</a>, in early 2020; the assessment found that Puerto Penasco has a higher prevalence of diabetes than the worldwide average, and social stigma and misinformation related to diabetic wound care has led to many diabetic amputations, with amputees finding it difficult to return to work and reintegrate into the community.</p>
